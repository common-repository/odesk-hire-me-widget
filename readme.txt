oDesk Profile Widget

== Description ==
oDesk currently disabled the hire me widget, this plugin trying to replace it.

simple to use, just put shortcode [odesk_hire_me profile_id="YOUR_PROFILE_ID" width="WIDGET_WIDTH"].

YOUR_PROFILE_ID is a string in your profile URL, this is my profile URL https://www.odesk.com/users/~01ce5c0257204323bb therefore my YOUR_PROFILE_ID is ~01ce5c0257204323bb. you can adjust width of the widget using WIDGET_WIDTH property, the value is in px.

that's it, simple plugin, simple use. happy spreading!
